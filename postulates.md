## The Postulates of Super Relativity
1. In Super Relativity, FTL communication must lead, necessarily, to causality violation.
2. a > c contradicts the totality of our experience so that the impossibility of this seems to be sufficiently proven.
3. Problem Solving has taken a dominant space-oriented [spatial] frame of reference whereas it needs to be more time-oriented i.e. propulsion systems vs. machines of time [time-machines].

*FTL stands for faster than light.
**Postulate 3 stands corrections.
